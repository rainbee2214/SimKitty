Kitten Flow:

if the kitten is doing an activity (n% chance it will continue to do that)
[Based on stats - an action could break the activity]
if (hungry) eat
if (playful) play
if (sleepy) sleep
**but for each of this, there is a chance that the kitten will just do something else instead
**when doing an action such as this, the temp stat involved will go down (mostly)

if (still not doing anything)
decide on an activity or continue to do nothing
**Choosing the activity will depend on the perm stats of the kitten

If an action is chosen


Food Supply: Each time a kitten eats food, your supply goes down by 1
-If you run out of food, every time a kitten tries to eat, it stays hungry, loses happiness and then does nothing instead

Toy supply: Each time a kitten is playing with a toy, it becomes unavailable for other kittens to play with
-If a kitten tries to play and there are no toys, it will lose some happiness and do nothing instead.
